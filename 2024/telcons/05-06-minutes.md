Dan: 2 weeks ago there was [an update](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/798#issuecomment-2070465245).

Max: Tess also had a comment about cross-platform implementation...

Max: in 2022 some experts from Apple [replied](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/41) that it's not feasible to implement in IOS...

Dan: I'm suggesting that we should close this as unsatisfied... since we don't seem to be getting anywhere and they are not engaging with our feedback?

Present:

Regrets:


#### [Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/899) - @hober, @hadleybeeman

Concerned that we don't have any unlinkable presentations/credentials.
Concerned that this is only JSON-LD and not raw documents.  Is that an IETF thing?
A reminder that this is a polyglot format (though this is just a general concern with JSON-LD).
Why can't this community pick a single format?  Is that so hard?
The +suffix business is still unresolved in the IETF.


Side bar: talk about age verification on the web and maybe issuing a finding on the subject.

#### Explainers

*We review discussion around adding explainers as first class citizens in w3c*

Amy: we need an "easy read" of complex / technical / legalistic document... 

Amy: *points out section in ActivityPub spec that has many diagrams and explains how it works*

Matthew: getting document right for the audience is very important...  Also related to cognitive accessibility.  Content and good editing is vital.  Nothing wrong with separate documents for separate audiences.

Dan: *bemaons lack of technical writers assigned to these projects.* Companies that are developing new specs should invest in explaining these specs - by employing technical writers.

Matthew: we should be proud - and yet we've coalesced around this as an idea... we had that freedom to do it in the best way and we've come up with something pretty good.  it's also a fairly mature format and you can spot when something is missing.

Amy: part of making it part of the process - burden of explaining concepts ... moving the burden back to the people developing the specs.  I wish we could just say "hire technical writers" ... but asking people to do extra things... could we support it in w3c? Writing support community group.
